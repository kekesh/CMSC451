\subsection{Introduction}

This is CMSC $451$: Design and Analysis of Algorithms. We will cover graphs, greedy algorithms, divide and conquer algorithms, dynamic programming, network flows, NP-completeness, and approximation algorithms.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Homeworks are due every other Friday or so; NP-homeworks are typically due every other Wednesday.
    \item There is a $25\%$ penalty on late homeworks, and there's one get-out-of-jail free card for each type of homework.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stable Marriage Problem}

As an introduction to this course, we'll discuss the \vocab{stable marriage problem}, which is stated as follows:

\begin{quote}
    Given a set of $n$ men and $n$ women, match each man with a woman in such a way that the matching is \textit{stable}.
\end{quote}

What do we mean when we call a matching is ``stable"? We call a matching \textit{unstable} if there exists some man $M$ who prefers a woman $W$ over the woman he is married to, and $W$ also prefers $M$ over the man she is currently married to.
