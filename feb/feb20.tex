\subsection{Scheduling}


\subsection{Caching}

A \vocab{cache} is a piece of hardware or software that stores data in a special location so that future requests for that data can be served in a high-speed manner. The idea of caching is to store frequently-used values in a special area so that we can access the values in a quick manner. If a value is \textit{not} cached, then we say that the value is stored in \vocab{main memory}.
